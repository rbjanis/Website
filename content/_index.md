I am currently a fifth year psychology doctorate student at Penn State and recently attained my MS degree. My research focuses on statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal psychotherapy outcome data and the prediction of psychotherapy outcomes. I also work as a data analyst for [The Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH)](http://ccmh.psu.edu), a network of 500+ college counseling centers collecting standardized data on college students seeking mental health treatment. After graduating, I hope to attain a data science position. 

Much of my time is spent playing with data in R, both for my research and for fun. I enjoy visualizations, tidy data, and  knitting Rmarkdown documents. This blog is a way for me to consolidate and share things I learn in R.  On my [blog](blog/), you can  check out some projects I've done, as well as a gallery of some of the [visualizations](visualizations/) I've created. You can also find a list of my [publications](publications/) and my [resume](resume/). Enjoy!
