I am currently a fifth year psychology doctoral student at Penn State. My research focuses on college student mental health, statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal psychotherapy outcome data, and the prediction of psychotherapy outcomes. I also work as a data analyst for [The Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH)](http://ccmh.psu.edu), a network of 550+ college counseling centers collecting standardized data on college students seeking mental health treatment. After graduating, I hope to attain a data science position. 

Much of my time is spent playing with data in R, both for work and for fun. I enjoy visualizations, tidy data, and  knitting Rmarkdown documents. This blog is a way for me to consolidate and share things I learn in R.  On my [blog](blog/), you can check out some projects I've done, as well as a gallery of some of the [visualizations](visualizations/) I've created. You can also find a list of my [publications](publications/) and my [resume](resume/). Enjoy!
