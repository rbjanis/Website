I am currently the associate director of data science at [The Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH)](http://ccmh.psu.edu), a network of 700+ college counseling centers collecting standardized data on college students seeking mental health treatment. The [CCMH Annual Report](https://ccmh.psu.edu/assets/docs/2021-CCMH-Annual-Report.pdf), [CCMH Blog](https://ccmh.psu.edu/blog), and [CLI Shiny App](https://ccmh.shinyapps.io/CLI-app/) are great introductions to what I do with CCMH.  

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing board games, and traveling.
