I am currently the associate director of data science at [The Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH)](http://ccmh.psu.edu), a network of 700+ college counseling centers collecting standardized data on college students seeking mental health treatment. The [CCMH Annual Report](https://ccmh.psu.edu/assets/docs/2021-CCMH-Annual-Report.pdf), [CCMH Blog](https://ccmh.psu.edu/blog), and [CLI Shiny App](https://ccmh.shinyapps.io/CLI-app/) are great introductions to what I do with CCMH. Most of my time is spent in R wrangling and modeling data, developing Shiny apps and internal R packages, and creating data viz. 

I have a PhD in Psychology from Penn State, which focused on modeling change during mental health treatment and predicting various aspects of treatment (e.g. suicide attempts, session utilization). My dissertation focused on evaluating the effectiveness of an algorithm I developed and implemented in 700+ counseling centers designed to alert therapists when their clients were at risk of a poor outcome in treatment.  

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing board games, and traveling.
