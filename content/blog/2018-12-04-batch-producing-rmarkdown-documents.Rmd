## Dyamically updating YAML

## Rendering Issue
I ran into an issue where the loop would render reports for a single school or even a couple schools just fine, but when I tried to run the loop on all 28 schools, Rstudio would inexplicably hang and eventually abort after about 5 reports. I found a solution on stack overflow to add `knitr::knit_meta(class=NULL, clean = TRUE)` to the beginning of the for loop, which allowed all the reports to render successfully.
