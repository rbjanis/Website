<p>With 2018 coming to a close and many of my friends posting their Spotify year in review showing their most listened to songs, I was feeling jealous as an Apple Music user that I couldn’t see my music year in review. So, in what could prove to be an embarassing foray into my very basic taste in music, I decided to make my own Apple Music year in review!</p>
<p>If you want to download your own Apple Music data, head to <a href="https://privacy.apple.com/account">Apple’s Data and Privacy</a> page, and select “Request a copy of your data.” You can select what specific data you want, and they will put together a file for you to download, emailing you when it’s ready. Mine took about 6 days for Apple to create the download. The specific file with your Apple Music listening history is “Apple Music Play Activity.csv”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(magrittr)
music &lt;- read.csv(here::here(&quot;content/blog/data/Apple Music Play Activity.csv&quot;), stringsAsFactors = F)</code></pre>
<p>A quick visual inspection of the data showed that this file dates back to 2015 when I first subscribed to Apple Music, but since I’m just interested in this past year, I created a data set of only this year’s data. In order to do that, I first had to convert the dates to a format R recognizes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>music$Event.Start.Timestamp &lt;- lubridate::ymd(substr(music$Event.Start.Timestamp, 1, 10))

music2018 &lt;- dplyr::filter(music, Event.Start.Timestamp &gt;= &quot;2018-01-01&quot; &amp; Event.Start.Timestamp &lt;= &quot;2018-12-31&quot;)  %&gt;% 
  dplyr::arrange(Event.Start.Timestamp)</code></pre>
<p>I noticed some interesting things about how song listening is recorded. If a song is paused in the middle, or if other events occur, the song is recorded on multiple rows broken up by the time the event occurred. In order to avoid counting duplicates or songs that I started playing then skipped, I decided to only include songs that I listened to at least half of, which removed about half of the lines in the data set.</p>
<p>Before removing entries, I totaled my play time to find that I listened to <strong>192</strong> hours of music last year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>music2018 &lt;- dplyr::filter(music2018, Play.Duration.Milliseconds/Media.Duration.In.Milliseconds &gt; .5)
music2018 &lt;- dplyr::filter(music2018, Play.Duration.Milliseconds == Media.Duration.In.Milliseconds)</code></pre>
<p>It looks like I listened to at least half of <strong>674</strong> songs <strong>1051</strong> times last year, and I rang in the 2018 new year listening to <strong>“Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall”</strong> by <strong>Coldplay</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>music2018_songs &lt;- dplyr::group_by(music2018, Song.Name, Artist.Name) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::summarize(N = n()) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::arrange(-N)</code></pre>
<p>Top songs Listening by month Listening by day of the week Songs with the highest skip Songs I listened to all the way through the most</p>
