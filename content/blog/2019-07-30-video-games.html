<p>The data from this post exploring video games comes from <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
library(&quot;magrittr&quot;)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
video_games &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-07-30/video_games.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Not knowing much about video game developers or publishers, I was interested in first getting a feel for who the most prolific developers and publishers are, as well as what some of their most popular games are.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>video_games %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(publisher)) %&gt;% 
  add_count(publisher) %&gt;% 
  mutate(publisher = fct_reorder(publisher, n)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(publisher)) %&gt;% 
  top_n(10) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = publisher, y = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = &quot;Publisher&quot;,
       y = &quot;Number of games&quot;,
       title = &quot;Top 10 video game publishers&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,300))</code></pre>
